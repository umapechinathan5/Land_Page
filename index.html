    <h4><b>Rebel poet</b></h4>
    <p>Kazi Nazrul Islam was a poet, musician, and revolutionary, best known as the national poet of Bangladesh. His impressively large collection of poetry and music with themes, such as religion, spiritualism, and humanity has inspired many in the past and continues to inspire modern-day activists and revolutionists. A collection of 4,000 songs, which are extremely popular in India and Bangladesh, is known as a whole as Nazrul Sangeet or Nazrul Geeti (Music of Nazrul)Nazrul took active part in the Indian Independence Movement after serving the British Indian Army during the First World War. For his tremendous contribution towards the field of music, literature, and art, Kazi Nazrul Islam was honored by the Government of India with the prestigious Padma Bhushan Award in 1960 </p>
  
  <h4><b>Awesome Writer</b></h4>
    <p>One of Nazruls most notable works during this period was his epic poem “Bidrohi” (“The Rebel”), which catapulted him to fame and earned him the title of the “Rebel Poet.” Published in 1922, “Bidrohi” became a rallying cry for the masses and symbolized the spirit of defiance against oppression and tyranny. Through powerful imagery and impassioned rhetoric, Nazrul celebrated the indomitable spirit of resistance and rebellion against injustice. Apart from his poetic endeavors, Nazrul was also a prolific songwriter and composer, revolutionizing the Bengali music scene with his innovative blend of classical and folk traditions. He composed numerous songs, known as “Nazrul Geeti,” which encompassed a wide range of themes, from love and longing to patriotism and social justice. His musical compositions, characterized by their lyrical depth and emotive melodies, continue to resonate with audiences to this day</p>
